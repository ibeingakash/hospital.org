									is the most advanced gene-editing technology yet. It works by 
									harnessing the natural mechanisms of the immune systems of bacterium
									cells of invading viruses, which is then able to ‘cut out’ infected
									DNA strands. This cutting of DNA is what has the power to potentially
									transform the way we treat disease. By modifying genes, some of the

									be overcome in a matter of years...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR#:~:text=CRISPR%20(%2F%CB%88kr%C9%AA,had%20previously%20infected%20the%20prokaryote.">continue reading</a></p>

                                    <p>Robotic surgery is used in minimally invasive procedures and helps to aid in precision,
									control and flexibility. During robotic surgery, surgeons can perform very complex procedures
									that are otherwise either highly difficult or impossible. As the technology improves, it can
									be combined with augmented reality to allow surgeons to view important additional information 
									about the patient in real time while still operating. While the invention raises concerns that
									it will eventually replace human surgeons, it is likely to be used only to assist and enhance
									surgeons’ work in the future. Read more about robotic surgery here...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-assisted_surgery#:~:text=Robotic%20surgery%20are%20types%20of,of%20surgeons%20performing%20open%20surgery.">continue reading</a></p>

									their condition under control and as many as 94% don’t use inhalers properly.To help asthma 
									sufferers to better manage their condition, Bluetooth-enabled smart inhalers have been developed.
									A small device is attached to the inhaler which records the date and time of each dose and whether 
									it was correctly administered. This data is then sent to the patients’ smartphones so they can keep
									track of and control their condition. Clinical trials showed that using the smart inhaler device used
									less reliever medicine and had more reliever-free days...<a href="https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/smart-inhalers-an-innovative-solution-for-management-of-respiratory-conditions/71608000">continue reading</a></p>
